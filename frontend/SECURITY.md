# Security Policy for StorageX

## Application Purpose

StorageX is a legitimate decentralized file storage application that uses:

- IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized storage
- Web3Auth for blockchain authentication
- Ethereum/Polygon networks for wallet integration
- Modern security practices for user data protection

## Security Measures

1. **Data Encryption**: All files are encrypted before storage
2. **Decentralized Storage**: Files stored on IPFS network
3. **Blockchain Authentication**: Wallet-based user authentication
4. **No Central Control**: Users own their data completely
5. **Open Source**: Code is publicly auditable

## External Dependencies

- Filebase.com (IPFS gateway provider)
- Web3Auth (authentication service)
- Ethereum/Polygon networks (blockchain networks)
- MongoDB Atlas (metadata storage)

## False Positive Explanation

This application may trigger security warnings due to:

- Web3/blockchain technology usage
- IPFS decentralized storage protocols
- Wallet integration patterns
- Modern Web3 authentication methods
